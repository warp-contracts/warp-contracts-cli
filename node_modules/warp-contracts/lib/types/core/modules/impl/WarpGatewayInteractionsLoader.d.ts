/**
 * The aim of this implementation of the {@link InteractionsLoader} is to make use of
 * Warp Gateway ({@link https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-sw-gateway})
 * endpoint and retrieve contracts' interactions.
 *
 * Optionally - it is possible to pass:
 * 1. {@link ConfirmationStatus.confirmed} flag - to receive only confirmed interactions - ie. interactions with
 * enough confirmations, whose existence is confirmed by at least 3 Arweave peers.
 * 2. {@link ConfirmationStatus.notCorrupted} flag - to receive both already confirmed and not yet confirmed (ie. latest)
 * interactions.
 * 3. {@link SourceType} - to receive interactions based on their origin ({@link SourceType.ARWEAVE} or {@link SourceType.REDSTONE_SEQUENCER}).
 * If not set, interactions from all sources will be loaded.
 *
 * Passing no flag is the "backwards compatible" mode (ie. it will behave like the original Arweave GQL gateway endpoint).
 * Note that this may result in returning corrupted and/or forked interactions
 * - read more {@link https://github.com/warp-contracts/redstone-sw-gateway#corrupted-transactions}.
